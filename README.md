## Features

- Uses [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) for weather data
- All images are included with the app. The app only uses your data to communicate with the weather and location APIs.
- Material Design
- Polished, animated weather updates
- A great looking customizable companion widget!
- Time and location-based cache. Weather Doge uses even less data and it loads super fast! By default, the cache expires in 10 minutes or when your location changes by 1.1 km or more.
- Ability to force metric units in locales where metric is not the default
- Option to set a constant location, instead of relying on location services.
- Configurable drop shadows for all text
- [Comic Neue](https://web.archive.org/web/20240515073740/https://comicneue.com/)
- Ability to force doge adjectives to appear above weather info
- Animated snowfall ❄️
- FOSS-only builds that do not rely on Google Play Services or other non-free binaries.
- Open-source!
